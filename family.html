	<h3>MY PARENTS</h3>
		<p>The picture above shows both of my parents. My parents are wonderful. I would love to tell you a little bit about my parents. My dad works as a broadcast technician at Media Prima company. Meanwhile, my mom is a nurse at Hospital Sungai Buloh. I love them both a lot and appreciate their effort and love in bringing me up to be a better individual. I am very lucky to have them both as my parents and thank God for giving me both of them. Mom and dadâ€¦ out of all the friends and teachers I have had in my life, you both have been the best.</p>
